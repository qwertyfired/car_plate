License Plate Detection and Recognition Model based on Semi supervised Learning		
1.	Project from the Korea Internet & Security Agency (KISA)
2.	Feature extraction layer based on VGG 16 for both detection and recognition
3.	Using not only labeled data but also unlabeled data.
4.	Model outperforms the comparative models in terms of data size and generalization capability

Text recognition model through image-to-text
1.	Capstone design project for graduation work for one semester
2.	Development of a system that utilized end-to-end model instead of using segmentation
3.	CNN was used to extract a matrix containing robust feature information about a string
4.	BiLSTM was used for recognizer that converted a matrix into time-series data
