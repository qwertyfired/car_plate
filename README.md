Intelligent Data Analysis Lab. in Dankook University
 Undergraduate researcher							       Dec.2022-Dec.2023
>	Data science research based on process mining and image processing 
>	Participated in research paper seminars

License Plate Detection and Recognition Model based on Semi supervised Learning		
 >	Project from the Korea Internet & Security Agency (KISA) 
 >	Feature extraction layer based on VGG 16 for both detection and recognition 
 >	Using not only labeled data but also unlabeled data.
 >	Model outperforms the comparative models in terms of data size and generalization capability

Text recognition model through image-to-text
 >	Capstone design project for graduation work for one semester
 >	Development of a system that utilized end-to-end model instead of using segmentation
 >	CNN was used to extract a matrix containing robust feature information about a string
 >	BiLSTM was used for recognizer that converted a matrix into time-series data
